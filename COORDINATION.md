# Agent coordination (multiple agents, multiple machines)

**jonny-boi** is built by several Claude agents — **including agents on different machines** that all
push to one repo. This file is the **shared cross-machine channel**: the repo is the only thing every
agent sees. Read it at the start of a session; update your section before you push.

## Hard rules (prevent two agents clobbering each other)
1. **`git fetch` before you integrate or push.** Never `git push --force` to `main`. Integrate by
   merging the latest `origin/main` first.
2. **One feature per branch, each in its own git worktree** (`feat/<slug>` / `fix/<slug>`), owning a
   **disjoint package** (DESIGN.md §6). Check this file's in-flight table + `git branch -r` before
   claiming work so two agents don't grab the same files.
2b. **Pick a unique branch slug.** If a `feat/<slug>` already exists on the remote, choose another.
3. **Workers push branches; they do NOT merge to `main`.** One **integrator** merges reviewed green
   branches to `main`, ships, and publishes the build.
4. **Know your build configs.** `npm test` (Vitest) judges green by "N passed, 0 failed"; the shippable
   artifact is `npm run build`.
5. **Definition of done** (DESIGN.md §7): feature + tests, full suite green, DESIGN §3 flipped,
   committed with **explicit paths** (never `git add -A`), pushed.

## Ship / release process (integrator)
Per landed feature/batch: merge → `npm run build` + `npm test` green → publish a verified build (deploy
the PWA / tag a `latest`) so collaborators and other machines get it. Keep sim throughput (games/sec)
from regressing.

## Roles
- **Integrator** — `DESKTOP-90PJPM4` (supervisor on this machine merges to `main` + ships).
- **Workers** — _(other machines / dispatched agents; add your hostname + branch when you join)_

## In-flight / ownership  (update when you start or finish)

| branch | owner / machine | files owned | status |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| _example_ | _hostname_ | _packages/..._ | 🚧 building / ✅ READY / ✅ INTEGRATED |

## Messages between agents
_Append dated notes here; keep them short. Newest at top._

- 2026-06-20 DESKTOP-90PJPM4: Repo seeded with rules + this board + DESIGN. Stack = TS npm-workspaces
  monorepo (core/cards/ai/sim/data-tools + apps/web PWA), Scryfall art, curated card pool. Node 24 LTS
  installed on this machine. Scaffold (§3.0) goes first and blocks all other work. (Supervisor)
