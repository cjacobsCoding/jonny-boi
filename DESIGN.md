# jonny-boi — Canonical Design

A Magic: The Gathering **deck-tuning lab**. Build a deck, let AI pilots play it hundreds of games
against a meta gauntlet, swap a single card, and get a **statistically definitive** verdict on whether
the deck got better — then let the engine **suggest the next improvement**. Real MTG cards and Scryfall
art, in a polished **PWA** that runs on PC, Android, and the browser.

This document is the **single source of truth** for requirements and architecture. Every contributor
(human or agent) reads this before touching code.

---

## 1. Engineering principles (non-negotiable)
1. **Data-driven.** Cards, decks, AI weights, sim params live in data with safe defaults. Adding a card
   or a meta deck = editing/adding a data file, never an engine change.
2. **Composition over inheritance.** A card = data referencing small composable **effect primitives**.
   No subclass-per-card. AI strategies / sim reporters / effects are small registered modules.
3. **DRY & self-documenting.** One mechanism per concept. Names explain intent; comments explain *why*.
   No magic numbers — costs, life totals, sim counts are named/derived.
4. **Fully tested.** Every pure-logic unit (rules, AI, sim, stats) ships with automated tests. A change
   that breaks an existing test is a regression and must be fixed before merge.
5. **Debug tooling.** Every new system is observable/drivable at runtime via the shared **inspector**
   (game-state dump, step priority, force draws, sim-log viewer) — not ad-hoc key bindings.
6. **Performance.** The sim runs thousands of games; the core hot path stays fast and allocation-light,
   and runs in both Node and a browser Web Worker. Instrument games/sec; no regressions.

## 2. Architecture seams (the contract all features plug into)
Features must NOT edit the core engine loop to integrate. They plug into these seams.

- **Card & effect-primitive registry** — a card is a **data record** (cost, types, P/T, keyword flags,
  an ordered list of effect references). Effect primitives (`dealDamage`, `drawCards`, `gainLife`,
  `createToken`, `pumpUntilEOT`, …) are small pure functions that **self-register** by id. New card =
  new data record (+ a new primitive only if a genuinely new mechanic). The engine resolves cards by
  looking up primitives — it never knows about specific cards.
- **Game state & event log** — all runtime state in plain-data structures (players, zones, the stack,
  mana pool, turn/phase). Every mutation emits a typed **event** to an append-only log; systems and the
  AI observe events without coupling to each other. This log is also the replay/inspector source.
- **AI-strategy registry** — an AI pilot implements `chooseAction(view, legalActions) → action` against
  a **read-only game view**. Strategies self-register by id (e.g. `random`, `heuristic`, `mcts`) and are
  selected by data (deck/match config), never hard-wired.
- **Sim harness & reporter registry** — the harness plays `runMatch(deckA, deckB, aiA, aiB, n)` headless
  and streams results to **reporters** (win-rate, mana-curve stats, A/B significance). Reporters
  self-register; adding a metric doesn't touch the match loop.
- **Data registries** — load every `data/<kind>/*` (cards, decks, ai-profiles, sim-presets); new content
  = drop a file, no code.
- **Card-art / data pipeline** — `data-tools` fetches card data + art from **Scryfall** for the curated
  pool and caches it locally (respecting Scryfall's API guidelines: rate limit, attribution, no bulk
  re-hosting). The engine and UI consume the cached, normalized card index — they never call Scryfall at
  play time.
- **Debug inspector** — data-driven runtime controls (the one home for debug/cheat tooling): state dump,
  step-through priority, forced draw/mulligan, event-log scrubber, live sim log.
- **Test framework** — Vitest; pure units auto-discovered. `npm test` must end `0 failed`.

### 2.1 State discipline
Keep all runtime state in small, owned, plain-data structures threaded through an explicit `GameState`
(+ typed event log) — never scattered module globals. The core is pure: no DOM, no network, no `Date.now`
in the hot path (seeded RNG for reproducible sims).

## 3. Roadmap
**Status legend:** ✅ done (implemented, tested, committed) · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ not started.
Keep markers honest — a feature is ✅ only once tests pass **and the work is committed/pushed**.

### 3.0 Monorepo scaffold + tooling — ✅ done  *(foundational — blocks everything)*
npm workspaces, TypeScript (strict), Vitest, ESLint/Prettier, Vite PWA shell, a `core` smoke test, and
`npm run build` / `npm test` / `npm run dev` wired. One owner; everyone branches off this.

### 3.1 Core rules engine — MVP — ✅ done
GameState + zones + event log; turn structure (untap/upkeep/draw/main/combat/end), priority & the stack,
mana pool & paying costs, playing lands, casting creatures/instants/sorceries, the combat step, state-based
actions, win/loss by life/decking. Seeded RNG. Pure + fully tested.

### 3.2 Card model + effect primitives + curated pool — ✅ done
The card data schema, the effect-primitive registry + a starter set of primitives, and an initial curated
card pool sufficient to express the meta decks. Each card is data; each primitive is tested.

### 3.3 Scryfall data-tools pipeline — ✅ done
Fetch + cache card data and art for the curated pool; produce a normalized card index the engine/UI use.
Robust to misses; respects Scryfall guidelines.

### 3.4 AI pilots — ⬜ not started
The `chooseAction` interface + read-only game view + legal-action generator; a `random` baseline and a
`heuristic` pilot good enough to play the meta decks competently. Tested against scripted scenarios.

### 3.5 Sim harness + statistics — ⬜ not started
Headless `runMatch`/`runGauntlet`; win-rate with **confidence intervals**; the **A/B single-card-swap**
test that returns a significance verdict ("card X is better/worse/inconclusive at N games"). `npm run sim` CLI.

### 3.6 Suggestion engine — ⬜ not started
Given a deck + the gauntlet, propose candidate single-card swaps, evaluate each via the sim, and rank by
win-rate delta + significance. The signature "make my deck better" loop.

### 3.7 Web PWA — deck builder + card browser + lab + match viewer — ⬜ not started
Professional React/Vite UI: browse cards (Scryfall art), build/edit decks, run the gauntlet and see
win-rate deltas, accept suggestions, watch/replay a match from the event log. Installable PWA (offline
shell), responsive for phone + desktop.

### 3.8 Meta-deck gauntlet content — ⬜ not started
The 5 curated meta decks (data) that define the baseline gauntlet, plus swap-candidate cards.

### 3.9 Core engine v2 — triggered abilities + continuous effects — ⬜ not started  *(quality gate for trustworthy sims)*
The §3.1 MVP resolves spells/ETB scripts only. To faithfully simulate real meta decks it needs: a
**triggered-ability system** (ETB/attack/cast/death triggers → the stack), a **continuous-effects / "until
end of turn" layer** with proper cleanup-step expiry (so `pumpUntilEndOfTurn` and similar wear off — current
behavior persists the buff and biases combat sims), and later **planeswalkers**, **transform/DFC**, and
**dynamic P/T** (e.g. Tarmogoyf). Tracked here because §3.2 cards stubbed these mechanics against the MVP.
Prioritize triggers + EOT-expiry before leaning on §3.5/§3.6 verdicts; the rest can follow.

## 4. Ways this project is distinctive (keep extending)
- **Iterative, statistically-grounded deck tuning** — not just "play vs humans," but a controlled A/B
  lab: swap one card, run the gauntlet, get a significance-tested verdict.
- **Engine-suggested improvements** — the app proposes the next card swap and proves it helped.
- **Real MTG cards + art** via Scryfall, with a fully-correct curated rules subset.
- **One pure engine, three surfaces** — Node CLI sims, browser Web-Worker sims, and the PWA all share
  the same deterministic core.

## 5. Tooling
- Build/test: see CLAUDE.md (`npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run dev`, `npm run sim`). Tests run on
  every feature via Vitest.
- A one-command way to launch the PWA (`npm run dev`) and to run a gauntlet from the CLI (`npm run sim`).

## 6. Parallel-development rules (so agents don't collide)
- The monorepo packages are the **disjoint ownership boundaries**:
  `packages/core`, `packages/cards`, `packages/ai`, `packages/sim`, `packages/data-tools`, `apps/web`.
  Each feature owns its package's `src/` + `data/`.
- New content (a card, a deck, an AI profile) goes in a feature-owned data file — never a shared one.
- Integrate only through the §2 seams. Do not edit another package's internals or the core engine loop.
- Every feature adds tests and leaves the full suite green.
- Claim work on `COORDINATION.md` before starting; pick a unique `feat/<slug>` branch.

## 7. Definition of done
Tests green · status flipped in §3 · committed with explicit paths · pushed · a build delivered to test.
Workers push branches; the integrator merges + ships (COORDINATION.md).
